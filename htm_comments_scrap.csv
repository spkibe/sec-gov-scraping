No. This proposal is a cheat rule aimed at killing the rise of at-home traders. Bloated investment managers can't keep up, so they take their millions of dollars to lobby you to rig the game in their favor. Keep the markets fair and transparent. Reject this proposal. "
S7-08-20,,,"Feb. 2, 2021","
I am AGAINST the proposed change of reporting for the 13F.
The SEC is chartered to make investing a level playing field for all investors.
This proposal does not fulfill that intent, if fact it slants the playing field in favor of the professional.
The SEC's contempt for the individual investor is obvious with their failure to implement Section 929X of the Dodd-Frank Act.
Section 929X of the Dodd-Frank Act, which the SEC has not yet implemented, directs the agency to promulgate rules obligating investment managers to publicly report short position activity at a minimum of once every month (with no more than a 15-day reporting period). 
The SEC should implement the rules it is by law required to."

I am an investor, and the 13f filings from my favorite guys are Monaish Pabari and Guy Spiers. Me and many other investors that vote our values with our money follow leaders like these in order to gain confidence in our investing decisions. If the SEC is meant to serve little guys like us, down turning the 13f from organizations under 3.5 billion would be a significant downside. Many small people like us who want to be a benefit to society, would have less information out there to invest in companies. It can also provide a significant hinder to our decision-making process/ and research to the future aspects of a strong company."

File No. S7-08-20, William Peysson,Retired CFO,"December 12, 2020",It's pretty simple.  I like to know certain information that this proposal would eliminate.  Who's buying or selling particular stocks is very helpful to me and many other traders.  Transparency of the transactions by the large money managers is something that should not be hidden from those of us who find that knowledge beneficial.
File No. S7-08-20, Anonymous,,"November 11, 2020","I wish to be Anonymous because it does not matter who I am but rather what I do that defines me.  Going from a threshold of 100 million to 3.5 billion is to large. I understand the reasons behind why 13f was created in the first place, I understand why the small manager has compliance costs and why they would want to be rid of them. However the aforementioned increase is to large, perhaps a middle ground compromise is in order. The uses of the 13f have evolved as the data points increased and this has had many unintended positive consequences. To eliminate so many small managers from the data points would eliminate all those positive consequences and findings. I understand the simple fix yet hard decision would be to raise the gate, but the question you pose is more complicated than that. That is why I propose amending 13f as you have stated while creating another separate filing that can cover the smaller dollar figures and smaller managers. A separate filing that can be much simpler, less comprehensive and less expensive. Certainly if the SEC can amend the  forms then certainly they do not need congress to create a new one for them. The new filing could be called form \""13s\"" homage to the 13f with the \""s\"" standing for \""small\"". Thank you for reading."

Please dont changes the 13f filings rule because it is one of the few ways that small investors can reduce the cost and time of researching stocks and evaluating professional portfolios. Its so helpful to have this information and changing the rule simply advantages the wealthier classes thereby increasing the class divide even further. 

If the SEC hopes to really continues to boost the economy, the best way to do that is to continue to provide the middle class opportunities for making money in the stock market. Knowing that bigger investors are buying specific stocks of interest is a so helpful, because it's an indication of  valuable and trusted companies. Information about the price, the percentage of an investors portfolio, and the price the stock was purchased at is so helpful in deciding if a particular company merits my purchase at this time for this price. 

Increasing the minimum to $3.5 billion will eliminate most of the professional investors from filing. The pros already limit the amount they invest in order to invest unnoticed. We need more disclosures instead of fewer disclosures. Please keep the 13F Rule- Respectfully Jaculine J Mitchell

The 13f filings rule as it stands is an important source of information to the average investor who is trying to learn how to responsibly invest in stocks. The professionals who currently are required to file 13f filings have access to more elite business people, business meetings, more education, and other experienced professionals than the average investor. The 13f filing requirement helps to narrow the gap between the average person and investors who have attended expensive, elite business schools. These pros, who already have access to lots of capital, not only had access to a costly education but also were able to build up networks to gain more information. The 13f filings help broaden this information to more than an elite few. Being able to see what percentage a pro bought a stock, in a price range, gives the average person access to information that would come up in professional conversations in elite circles that have restricted access just by virtue of who you know.

If you care about the wealth divide getting larger, please do not remove one of rules that helps to make access to information more equitable, information about what the best institutional investors in the world are doing.

As an individual investor, the ability to confirm some of my own research by being able to see how like-minded investors are managing their portfolio is an incredible advantage and confidence boost.  In light of the information age, the fact that we would be restricting information seems like the antithesis of what the SEC has tried to do over the course of the last 40+ years.  Transparency has always been at the forefront of what the SEC has tried to provide to investors to ensure that they were not being taken advantage of and a change in the reporting rule seems like a total about face.  Additionally, with Wall Street being massively under the microscope with the recent political turmoil, how does less transparency help to assuage the masses who feel like Wall Street is a ""Boys Club"" that is only out for themselves.

Adjusting the reporting threshold solely based on increases in market size ignores and does not account for the increasing ownership of the market by institutional investors. If one of the goals of the 13(f) disclosure program is to ""facilitate consideration of the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the securities markets and the public policy implications of that influence."", then some compensating factor which would lower the disclosure threshold from $3.5 billion should be included."

File No. S7-08-20,Jonathan K Sheehan,none,"August 20, 2020","I disagree with the increased threshold for filing. This system was put in place to help the average investor achieve a more level playing field and benefit by seeing what the professionals are buying and selling. By raising that threshold it provides fund managers who have been purposefully keeping their funds under the threshold to avoid reporting the latitude to greatly increase their profits while still not reporting which does not seem benefit anyone other than fund mangers while hurting the average investor. Many of us rely on following these larger investors for a view of the market health and overall direction as well as identifying opportunities and re-evaluating current positions and disposition. While larger institutions make major moves within the market which create the large waves we rely on still being able to follow the smaller and nimbler investors to find our best strategies. In conclusion, I wish to say I do not see a benefit to the general public by raising the limit and believe it will hurt investors who do not want to utilize large funds to manage their investments and pay what is essentially a tax for it. For those of us who are too small to be able to enter a hedge fund, but do not wish to entrust our retirements to people who get paid whether they provide a return or not, the ability to track the moves of these smaller individual investors and funds is critical.

As a CFO of a small cap company, I would review 13F filings each quarter to understand the makeup of our company's shareholder base, which was dominated by firms with far less than $3.5 billion AUM.  This information was tremendously helpful for investor communications and, ultimately, helped the company raise capital to grow the business.

File No. S7-08-20,Marilyn Reiter,,"August 12, 2020","the proposed change to increase the 13F requirements for hedge funds from $100M to 3.5B is a crazy increase.  It shows the leverage that the hedge funds have on the SEC and how they want to keep all the money transactions private.  For a retail investor we have neither the funds or influence to swing stock prices the way the hedge funds companies do.  It is useful for me to know what they are invested in so I can understand who the large influencers are on a company.  I understand that this requirement has not been adjusted since 1975 so increasing it some is reasonable.  I would like to know why this doesnt follow an increase with inflation?  The most that would make sense is $400M.  It seems like this change in the rule is to once again, accommodate the big time hedge fund operator and mow over the small retail investor."

File No. S7-08-20,Jim Ryan,,"August 11, 2020","	Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will severely limit future academic research on markets, investing and securities.

	Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will reduce public companies' opportunity to know more about who their shareholders are.

	Many managers are known to talk among themselves, sharing ideas and information. They have access to company management that small investors don't. Given the SEC's emphasis on a level fair playing field, this rule change makes no sense.

	The justification for the rule change is highly questionable.

	When is less transparency and less data ever a good thing for the small investor?

	Some investors may want to avoid over-owned stocks, believing they have a high level of risk. This rule change greatly reduces individual investors ability to reduce their risk.

	In the event of a significant correction the number of reporting managers would be diminished even further.  The SP suffered a 56.4% decline during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  A similar event using the most recent quarter as an example, would have reduced the number of funds by another 31% at a time when such data is needed even more.

File No. S7-08-20,Michael  Baker,,"August 6, 2020","Hello, I am a small investor.  Congress passed the 13-f rule to better maintain a fair market for all investors.  By raising the limits on this rule from $100M to $3.5B, you are defeating the purpose of the rule, and you are giving yet another huge edge to investment managers over the small retail investors.  The costs for these money managers to file these reports are minuscule compared to the amount of money they are managing--they do not need relief--this is not a burden to them. Large money managers already have a huge advantage over small investors, and this will hurt market transparency.  This will just create more wealth inequality in our society allowing the rich to get richer.  Given this limit was instituted over 40 years ago, however, I would be in support of a more modest increase in line with the rise in inflation over this period, to $400M.  At the same time, I would suggest you reduce the window for filing these reports from 45 days to 30 days, and change the frequency to a monthly basis vs. a quarterly basis.  Given all the advances in computer technology over the last 40+ years, these money managers should be able to provide more timely reports to the public and at a much lower cost than they were 40+ years ago."

More transparency enables a better view of market activities and peer comparisons by investors. This is a matter of serving investors properly. They pay the freight for services and should be able to expect transparency.

What is to prevent any institutional money manager from setting up separate entities wherein they could move assets under management below the $100 million threshold to avoid any transparent reporting?

The Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, File No: S7-08-20 proposes to remove the current transparency by raising the reporting limit from $100M to $3.5B.  As commonly known investment managers are known to talk among themselves, sharing ideas and information and have access to company management that small investors like me and many others simply can't access nor benefit.  My understanding is that the SEC supports a level playing field for all especially when you factor in the dark pool, automated trading and many other tools we as small investors just don't have.  


The $100M threshold is already a very high number in anybody's book even Warren Buffet's.  This rule change makes no sense and I urge you to drop it entirely or at least keep the $100M threshold."
File No. S7-08-20,"THOMAS C LEITNER, MD",,"July 27, 2020",The fact that you are proposing decreasing the threshold for institutional investors requiring reporting transactions runs counter to the government's aim to increase transparency. This seems to be a decision which was reached because of some strong arm tactics by interested parties and smells of government hypocricy and lobbyist involvementi

File No. S7-08-20,Michael Temple,,"July 27, 2020",I am an individual investor that relies on this information to make better investment decisions. Why would you ever want to create LESS transparency in the markets so many investors from people investing their 401(k) to IRA for retirement and make it more difficult for them to be successful?
File No. S7-08-20,Dennis George,,"July 27, 2020","The new rule proposes that the $100 million threshold be raised to $3.5 billion.

Buffett, Icahn and Ackman would still be required to file, as they are giants in the industry. But 90% of other institutions would not.

In the first quarter of 2020, 5,293 institutions filed 13Fs. Under the new proposal, that number would have dropped to 549.

It's not just a matter of seeing which individual star money managers bought and sold stock. Knowing if institutions are collectively buying or selling certain stocks is important information - and it's useful for companies to know who their shareholders are as well.

The strange thing is that the SEC claims it wants to increase transparency in the market, yet this rule will do exactly the opposite...

It will hide the transactions and holdings of all but the very largest institutions, keeping average investors in the dark about what the ""smart money"" is buying and selling.

Daniel Collins of WhaleWisdom says...

Many managers are known to talk among themselves, sharing ideas and information. They have access to company management that small investors don't. 

Given the SEC's emphasis on a level fair playing field, this rule change makes no sense.

The SEC is supposed to regulate and be a watch dog for any fraud or shady stock market activities, of which the 13F filings are a great step towards transparency and policing.

    Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will severely limit future academic research on markets, investing and securities.

    Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will reduce public companies' opportunity to know more about who their shareholders are.

    Many managers are known to talk among themselves, sharing ideas and information. They have access to company management that small investors don't. Given the SEC's emphasis on a level fair playing field, this rule change makes no sense.

    The justification for the rule change is highly questionable.

    When is less transparency and less data ever a good thing for the small investor?

    Some investors may want to avoid over-owned stocks, believing they have a high level of risk. This rule change greatly reduces individual investors ability to reduce their risk.

    In the event of a significant correction the number of reporting managers would be diminished even further.  The SP suffered a 56.4% decline during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

  Given the SEC's emphasis on a level fair playing field, this rule change   makes no sense. The reasoning behind the proposed change is the possible   reduction in costs and burdens to smaller managers.  This justification   is nonsense. I have asked several managers that file and they say it is a   highly automated process that effectively costs nothing. The claimed cost   savings are completely inaccurate.


  One SEC commissioner, Allison Heren Lee, has already voiced her opposition to   this proposal.  https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-13f-reporting-2020-07-10

Entire purpose of the SEC is to provide for a transparent cover over the financial markets and for you to even consider reducing transparency in any area is outrageous. I personally believe that just for proposing this the SEC should be shut down. I think it's time institutions that have been in effect for many many many years rethink their strategy and whether or not they are useful to those that they serve and I want to remind you that you serve me not yourselves. Shame on all of you who worked behind the scenes to bring this to light and shame triple on those of you who support it. Many hats off to any of you who oppose it.

This is a form of regulatory capture where the agency is actually working for the industry its supposed to be regulating. This does not help the retail investor at all, this change helps only the hedge funds and other larger family offices. Most large hedge funds have AUM of 1 billion to 3 billion, so all the major hedge funds would be exempt from reporting If anything, the AUM requirement should be about $400 million, which accounts for inflation instead of the market growth calculation used here. I think an industry regulator should be enacting protections for the retail investor and not the other way around. This proposal should require the reporting of not only long positions, which it already does but also short positions. This would provide huge insight to where the institutional investors think the market is headed. More information provided to the market albeit delayed will create a more efficient market which is the goal.

Reporting of holdings is not a complex reporting problem. Every investor has a close watch on their holdings so reporting them is not a burden.  The current rule should be expanded to report long and short positions so it is a more complete picture.  Consider instead adjusting the threshold for inflation (approximately $400M) or the percentage of funds covered by the original rule being maintained in the current total number of available funds instead.  The new $3.5B limit is more than necessary to reset the threshold to current equivalency.

This refers to the change in filing threshold proposed by the SEC for holders of 13F securities. It is our humble contention that the cost/benefit analysis presented by SEC for said change misses the mark on both sides of the equation. 

In our view, SECs focus was aimed at providing regulatory relief to smaller asset managers, which on its face is welcome. However, it is our contention that it does an incomplete job of accurately reflecting the de minimis cost associated with said filing. 

It is our belief that the methodology presented in the proposal to estimate cost is inflated and hard to reconcile with tangible experience. Our belief was already articulated by SEC Commissioner Lee in her public retort (July 10, 2020) to said proposal. As Commissioner Lee so eloquently described, SECs estimation of per manager cost associated with 13F filing represents a nearly 400% cost inflation versus their prior robust analysis, conducted less than 2 years ago. This is a curious development. 

Furthermore, it contradicts a reasonable expectation of cost deflation associated with an easily automatable task. Such automations need not be the job of the investment manager and have been made readily available by numerous counterparties (e.g., brokers, custodians, administrators), largely for free. These innovations have only accelerated in recent years since the SECs migration to XML filing for Form 13F in 2013. 

Given our belief that the task of generating a Form 13F is both simple and easily rules based, it is reasonable to expect this filing cost to follow most commodity-function cost curves. This is our central point of disagreement with the purported cost-benefit of regulatory relief. 

Far more importantly, the diminished transparency proposed by SEC levies a huge cost that is bizarrely unaccounted for in the proposal. It is our central contention that SEC did not adequately address the costs borne by various members of the domestic equity capital market ecosystem. Principally, institutional investors (LPs), corporates, academics, and the public writ large will be harmed by this change. To summarize each: 

Direct Harm to LPs and academics 

- The proposed change damages the LP community, which uses 13F transparency as a tool for oversight and diligence for non-transparent managers

- The proposed change damages the LP and academic community by eliminating an analytical lens of aggregate hedge fund manager behavior across US equities, for which there is no ready substitute 

Indirect Harm to Capital Markets (GPs and Corporates) 

- the proposed change damages capital market efficiency, notably for small and mid-sized corporates  which on average have more active ownership and rely on 13Fs for visibility into their own shareholder base

- the proposed change damages active managers who benefit from coordinating with other shareholders to improve corporate governance habits through their shareholder rights 

Given an incomplete analysis of both purported savings and added costs, we are respectfully but vehemently against the heart of the proposal. 

There are several other minor changes proposed by SEC, to which we provide comments and feedback in our itemized responses to their questions. To summarize, these ancillary changes are net beneficial. 

Respectfully,

Michael Perlow Faryan Amir-Ghassemi - Epsilon Asset Management 

--- 

1. Should we, as proposed, adopt an amendment to rule 13f-1 that would initially adjust the reporting threshold under rule 13f-1? Is the proposed threshold of $3.5 billion appropriate? If another threshold would be more appropriate, what should the threshold be and why? 

It is our belief that an upward adjustment for the reporting threshold under rule 13f-1 has significant costs associated with it, as it pertains to the transparency afforded to institutional investors, as well as publicly traded corporates. When these costs are appropriately accounted for, the value of an upward adjustment is quite bleak. 

We further believe the reporting burden as purported by SEC is vastly inflated given the plethora of technological tools available to simply export a list of long equity holdings through XML. As such, the decision behind a threshold increase seems specious at best. 

2. Would raising the reporting threshold for Form 13F to $3.5 billion negatively affect the utility of Form 13(f) data or investor confidence in the integrity of the U.S. markets? If so, how? And if so, is there a different threshold that would be more appropriate? Are there any additional effects of raising the Form 13F reporting threshold that we have not considered? 

It is our firm belief that raising the threshold for Form 13F to $3.5 billion will negative affect the utility of the data as well as investor confidence in the integrity of U.S. Markets. We believe so for several reasons: 

- Investors (namely qualified purchasers) of non-transparent investment firms (namely private partnerships) will lose a key form of oversight as to the investment activities of these firms. This will damage the LP community which uses this information source to strength the principal / agent relationship between GPs and LPs. 

- While it is true that (as of 12/31/2018), 90.8 percent of the dollar value of the Form 13F holdings data would be retained with this proposal, the vast majority of that dollar value would be associated with passive investment firms, for which the transparency provides relatively limited value compared to that of active private partnerships. 

- The majority of dollar value transparency lost will come from active participation in US securities, which act as marginal price-setters of securities. This will have an amplified impact in terms of reducing shareholder and corporate transparency. 

- If there is value in this information in lowering the cost of capital formation and improving the functioning of capital markets (it is our contention that there is), this will damage those positive benefits. 

- Given the disproportionate participation of active owners in smaller and mid capitalization securities, it will also disproportionately harm those portions of the market. 

3. Should we, as proposed, adopt an amendment to rule 13f-1 that would initially adjust the Form 13F reporting threshold based on the growth in the U.S. equities market? Should we, as described above, use the Federal Reserve Boards flow of funds data on corporate equities as a basis for this calculation? 

Anchoring a change in threshold to the growth in U.S. equities is not (in our opinion) an appropriate gauge. This is because the nature of complexion of U.S. capital markets have changed tremendously over the last 4 decades, namely through the rise of intermediaries that act as agents on behalf of an increasingly larger institutional ownership base of U.S. equities. If anything, given the increased importance of the financial sector as a function of the US economy, greater regulatory oversight of these intermediaries could be argued. 

4. Rather than adjusting the Form 13F reporting threshold based on the growth in the U.S. equities market that occurred between 1975 and December 2018 (a date certain), should we instead use an average rate of growth, which might effectively reflect market growth while minimizing the effects of market fluctuations around the time the Commission is adjusting the threshold? For example, under this approach, we could take the market size as of the end of 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, average those values, and compare that average to the size of the U.S. equities market in 1975. If so, why? Is such a five-year period (or other period) more appropriate for calculating an average growth rate to apply over the 45 years since the threshold was initially set? 

We are against such a metric, for the reasons above (e.g., response #3), but also because such a drastic change would adversely impact the expanded benefit of 13F disclosure, causing a net cost to the aggregate ecosystem. 

5. Should we instead adjust the reporting threshold for Form 13F using stock market returns as a basis for this calculation? If so, how should we measure stock market returns? For example, would dividends be included or excluded? Is there another measure that we should use as a basis for initially adjusting the reporting threshold? 

See #4. 

6. Should we instead adjust the reporting threshold for Form 13F to account for consumer price inflation? If so, what measure of consumer price inflationPCE or CPIshould we use? Is there another measure of consumer price inflation (or other inflation measure) that we should use? If so, what? 

See #4 

7. Should we adopt a different rounding convention, rather than the nearest $500 million, such as the nearest $1 billion, $250 million, or $100 million? For example, if we rounded to the nearest $100 million, the reporting threshold would be $3.6 billion based on stock market growth. If we should use a different rounding convention, why? 

We have no perspective on this matter. 

8. Are the Form 13F filing obligations burdensome to smaller managers? If so, how? Are they burdensome in absolute terms, relative terms, or both? Are the burdens on smaller managers different in character from the burdens on larger managers? 

We personally do not believe so, given the accumulation of ones exposures is manifold to basic portfolio and risk management for a registered investment adviser. The exporting of such data to the SEC through EDGAR has become trivially easy due to technological integration. For example, Epsilons brokerage platform affords for easy and free export of Form 13F, 13D/G XML securities custodied. It can be customized output based upon selected accounts and accounts for the delineation of key matters such as voting rights. 

This tooling is available from other commonly used technology and counterparty platforms, such as custody, administration, and OMS/PMS systems. Given we do not file Form 13F, we asked several peer managers who do, including recent first-time filers. They cited 1-2 hours of time associated with the filing and $250, each. These figures are presented with an abundance of caution according to one, and this anecdotal data is contrary to the SECs estimation of cost. 

9. What, if any, are the benefits to investors and markets for the markets to have access to Form 13F data from smaller managers? Do these benefits justify the filing burdens? If so, why? 

For institutional investors (LPs) who allocate capital to firms that do not readily provide transparency, 13F acts as a form of monitoring and diligence, improving the working dialogue between principal (LP) and agent (investment manager, or GP), especially with smaller firms. The range of such monitoring and diligence can include improving alignment between the two parties, ensuring IPS compliance, all the way to avoiding / surfacing fraud. An additionally ancillary benefit is the sourcing of investment talent, which can be done by proxy through Form 13F transparency. 

Regarding corporates, the increased transparency regarding ones shareholder base is an important tool for ensuring the healthy maintenance of corporate governance, and acts as a leveling playing field versus the expensive acquisition of corporate surveillance services. This is especially the case across smaller and mid-capitalization securities where there is a disproportionate percentage of ownership across what would be non- obliged filers.

For investment managers seeking to effectuate change due to perceived corporate governance issues, the ability to know the identity of peer shareholders is important in catalyzing such change when other forms of disclosure (e.g., 13D/G) are not accessible. 

Finally, for academics who perform research on otherwise non-transparent market actors, the benefit to access Form 13F is in being able to form a more complete picture of the activities and ownership patterns of active managers. This benefits all members of the ecosystem. 

10. Are the Form 13F filing obligations burdensome to larger managers? If so, how? Is it beneficial to the markets to continue to have access to Form 13F data from larger managers? If so, why? Do these benefits justify the filing burdens? If so, why? 

We do not believe so. We believe the regulatory costs associated with Form 13F are de minimis for large managers and already overstated by SEC. The benefit for larger managers is in the ability for the surfacing of their portfolio positions to provide information to the market. The most emblematic case of this is with activist managers who publicize their positions vocally, adding information to capital markets (see Brav et al., 2008, Journal of Finance). This information is beneficial to not only the investment manager but the beneficial owner of the securities through improved price discovery. 

11. Who uses Form 13F data? Are these uses beneficial to investors, market integrity, or capital formation? Why or why not? How will these users of the data be affected if the reporting threshold is increased and fewer filers report? Do those users prefer a different threshold? Why or why not? Can those users reasonably find alternative sources of data that meet their needs? Why or why not? 

The entire market ecosystem leverages Form 13F, most notably LPs and corporates. GPs also use it (having worked with dozens of hedge funds who consume 13F analysis, we can attest to this). The proposed change of threshold limits the ancillary benefit of increased market transparency into the behavior of non-transparent market actors. 

12. We estimate above direct compliance costs that smaller managers incur in connection with Form 13F. Are these estimates accurate? What kinds of costs, and in what amounts, do smaller managers incur in connection with Form 13F? How do the costs differ for larger and smaller managers? How much internal time do managers devote to compliance with Form 13F? What are the external costs, such as the cost of a third-party vendor or external legal counsel, associated with complying with Form 13F? We request comment on the direct compliance costs managers experience in connection with Form 13F, including the estimates in Section III below, and how these costs vary among managers. 

We believe these estimates are inaccurate for most investment management firms, specifically single strategy or single-vehicle private partnerships. The export of ones eligible holdings data into a 13F XML format is a commoditized function in 2020. It requires minimal investment of time, experience, or expertise, especially for a firm accustomed to filing. 

Where costs may be more onerous include financial advisors or other registered investment advisors that have numerous client accounts with disparate custodial relationships. Even still, aggregation of holdings should already be a basic obligation of sensible portfolio and risk management 

13. We also request comment on indirect costs that may be incurred in connection with Form 13F. We discuss above some of these indirect costs, such as the potential for front-running and copycatting. Do commenters agree that these indirect costs are incurred? How do these indirect costs differ for larger and smaller managers? Are there other or different indirect costs that are incurred in connection with Form 13F? What are those and how would they be affected by the proposed amendments? 

We believe front-running costs are not a sensible fear, as 13Fs are representative of position holdings as of a 45-day lag. How can someone reading stale information front run an investment manager? 

Regarding copycatting, investment managers who fear their intellectual property can be copied are in fact symbiotically aided by those that carry out such a strategy. This is because said investment managers can anticipate a bid associated with the disclosure of their portfolio holdings. This is analogous to the common practice of activist investors who publicize their positions and often position their exposure around the disclosure of said information (e.g., through short-dated derivatives). 

This dynamic is clearly explained through academic research (see Hirshliefer, Subrahmanyan, et al. 1994, Journal of Finance). Such an equilibrium provides a capital markets information advantage for said managers. Or as the authors say, investors who discover information early trade aggressively in the initial period and then partially reverse their trades in the next trading round, when the trades of the investors who become informed at this later date cause the price to more fully reflect the investors' information. This benefits GPs and their beneficial owners. 

14. Rather than the staff conducting periodic reviews of the Form 13F reporting threshold, should we instead adopt a periodic automatic adjustment to the Form 13F reporting threshold? If so, how often should the reporting threshold be automatically adjusted? If we adopt an automatic adjustment, what measure should we use to make the adjustment? Should we use consumer price inflation measures such as the CPI or PCE? Should we use stock market growth or stock market returns instead? Is there a different measure that would be more appropriate? If so, please explain why. If we use any of these measures, how should they be measured and as of what date? If we use an adjustment based on stock market growth or returns, the adjustment could be positive or negative compared with the present level. Would such an automatic adjustment raise any additional issues that the Commission should take into account in considering such an automatic adjustment? 

The choice behind an automatic adjustment should be founded upon the implied benefit from altering the filing requirement, which we believe is invalid. It is our belief that additional transparency adds efficiency to capital markets, rendering a systematic recalibration a moot point. 

Like any technology cost function, the cost associated with the regulatory burden will only decline over time due to data extraction technologies and automation. It is in fact our contention that such costs have already flattened tremendously, and that SECs analysis is blind to this fact. As such, this seems to be a non sequitur. 

15. Should we, as proposed, eliminate the omission threshold? Why or why not? 

Given the ease for transmitting holdings electronically, eliminating the omission threshold only makes the filing of 13F easier as there is one less step between the execution and transmission of the extract, as it pertains to review with ones existing portfolio. 

16. If the Form 13F reporting threshold is raised to $3.5 billion as proposed, to the extent it is not already reported on a voluntary basis, would investors and the markets find the disclosure of smaller holdings information for larger managers valuable? Why or why not? 

We disagree with the premise. 

17. Among Form 13F filers with at least $3.5 billion of 13(f) securities under management, is it costly to report small positions? Why or why not? How many of these filers positions have fewer than 10,000 shares? How many of their positions are valued under $200,000? What is the incremental cost of reporting these small positions on Form 13F? Is the incremental cost significant? Are there other costs associated with identifying these specific positions for purposes of excluding them? Are there other reasons that it would be beneficial to keep the omission threshold? 

N/A 

18. Rather than eliminating the omission threshold, should we increase it? If so, what part should we increase? Should we adjust only the share limit of the omission threshold? If so, to what? Should we adjust only the value limit of the omission threshold? If so, to what? Should we adjust both components of the omission threshold? If so, to what? Should we, for example, increase the share limit to 50,000 and the value limit to $1,000,000? 

We disagree with increasing the omission threshold, as it only adds confusion to a straightforward extraction process and doesnt protect intellectual property. 

19. Should we mirror the adjustment to the omission threshold proportionately to the adjustment we are proposing for the Form 13F reporting threshold using stock market growth? Would such an adjustment result in a significant decrease in securities reported on Form 13F? Would such an adjustment impede the ability of the public to observe the impact managers have on the markets? 

Doing such would arbitrarily harm transparency with limited to no benefit. 

20. If we maintain an omission threshold, should we adopt a mechanism for automatic future adjustments of the omission threshold? Should future adjustments be for the share limit, for the value limit, or for both? What is an appropriate mechanism for adjusting the share limit? 

We disagree with the premise. 

21. Should we require managers to provide their CRD number and SEC filing number, if any, on Form 13F? 

We believe this is a strong benefit. This allows market participants attempting to unravel convoluted ownership structures and crosslink CIK with CRD, to do so without liberal assumptions. 

22. Should we require managers to provide the CRD number and SEC filing number, if any, of other managers identified in their 13F report? 

We believe so. 

23. Would this additional identifying on Form 13F be useful information? If so, how? 

Yes, because it allows for cleaner segmentation of 13F aggregate filings with structured information provided in Form ADV1. 

24. Would disclosing this information be unduly burdensome for 13F filers? No, it would be rather trivial. 

25. Are there any other amendments we should make to the information provided on Form 13F? For example, is there any information currently required that is not useful or does not have a beneficial effect for investors, reporting managers, or users of the data? Should we consider omitting Form 13Fs requirement to provide a CUSIP number for each security? Why or why not? Should we permit managers to provide, in lieu of a CUSIP number, other identifiers such as a Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI) for each security? Why or why not? Would permitting voluntary use of an alternate identifier have a beneficial effect for investors, reporting managers, or users of the data? 

We believe the current standard of security identification does an appropriate job of balancing unique security identification with the costs associated with a commercial provider of said identifiers. 

26. Should we require filers to round all dollar values listed on Form 13F to the nearest dollar and remove the requirement to omit 000? Should we, alternatively, maintain the current rounding conventions? Should we adopt some other rounding conventions? Should we no longer permit rounding? 

We have no view on this matter. 

27. Are there any other amendments we should make to streamline Form 13F or simplify its instructions? If so, what are they? 

There is currently an exclusion clause that allows an entity to avoid filing Form 13F if they do not use US Mail. There is anecdotal evidence of clever foreign asset owners who use this as a loophole to avoid filing. This should likely be addressed before it broadens into a larger problem. 

28. Will our proposed technical amendments increase the accuracy of Form 13F data? 

We have no view on this matter. 

29. Will our proposed technical amendments make Form 13F data easier to understand and more accessible to the public? 

We have no view on this matter. 

30. Would these proposed technical amendments impose costs or burdens on filers? 

We do not believe so. 

31. Does the amendment appropriately reflect the effect of the U.S. Supreme Courts June 24, 2019, decision in Food Marketing Institute v. Argus Leader Media on the type of information that is required to substantiate confidential treatment in accordance with Exchange Act sections 13(f)(4) and (5) and rule 24b-2 thereunder? 

We have no view on this matter. 

32. Would relieving smaller managers from the compliance burdens of Form 13F reduce costs and enhance competition and add efficiency, including enhancing the ability of smaller managers to compete in the market? To what extent, if any, would the benefits be passed on to investors in the form of lower management fees and/or enhanced services? Would the proposed increase in the Form 13F threshold protect smaller managers from harmful behaviors such as front-running? Would reducing this risk for smaller managers promote capital formation by encouraging these managers to invest more in small and mid-size portfolio companies? Would reducing this risk for smaller managers benefit investors? 

The net cost of such a change will not add efficiency to the market. One could argue that management fees will to the contrary increase, as investment managers (acting as agents) will have more bargaining leverage against institutional allocators (acting as principals) once transparency is harmed. There is ample evidence of such in principal/agent research. We do not understand how obviating a Form 13F filing will protect an investor from front-running given the inherent lag associated with the filing. 

33. Would the proposed technical amendments increase efficiency by enhancing the accuracy of Form 13F data? Are the cost estimates appropriate?

We have no view on this matter. 

34. Would the proposed additional identifying information increase efficiency by making it easier to identify a Form 13F filers other regulatory filings and the interrelationships between managers who share investment discretion over 13(f) securities? 

Providing a systematic mapping between CIK and CRD is a positive step in providing transparency between the interrelationships between filing entities and registered investment advisors. "

File No. S7-08-20,"Brett James Bussell, Bussell",CEO,"July 19, 2020","Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will severely limit future academic research on markets, investing and securities.

Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will reduce public companies' opportunity to know more about who their shareholders are.

Many managers are known to talk among themselves, sharing ideas and information. They have access to company management that small investors don't. Given the SEC's emphasis on a level fair playing field, this rule change makes no sense.

The justification for the rule change is highly questionable.

When is less transparency and less data ever a good thing for the small investor?

Some investors may want to avoid over-owned stocks, believing they have a high level of risk. This rule change greatly reduces individual investors ability to reduce their risk.

In the event of a significant correction the number of reporting managers would be diminished even further.  The SP suffered a 56.4% decline during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

Going from a threshold of 100 million to 3.5 billion is to large.

However the aforementioned increase is to large, perhaps a middle ground compromise is in order. The uses of the 13f have evolved as the data points increased and this has had many unintended positive consequences. To eliminate so many small managers from the data points would eliminate all those positive consequences and findings. I understand the simple fix yet hard decision would be to raise the gate, but the question you pose is more complicated than that. That is why I propose amending 13f as you have stated while creating another separate filing that can cover the smaller dollar figures and smaller managers. A separate filing that can be much simpler, less comprehensive and less expensive. Certainly if the SEC can amend the  forms then certainly they do not need congress to create a new one for them.

Please dont changes the 13f filings rule because it is one of the few ways that small investors can reduce the cost and time of researching stocks and evaluating professional portfolios. Its so helpful to have this information and changing the rule simply advantages the wealthier classes thereby increasing the class divide even further. 

If the SEC hopes to really continues to boost the economy, the best way to do that is to continue to provide the middle class opportunities for making money in the stock market. Knowing that bigger investors are buying specific stocks of interest is a so helpful, because it's an indication of  valuable and trusted companies. Information about the price, the percentage of an investors portfolio, and the price the stock was purchased at is so helpful in deciding if a particular company merits my purchase at this time for this price.

The 13f filings rule as it stands is an important source of information to the average investor who is trying to learn how to responsibly invest in stocks. The professionals who currently are required to file 13f filings have access to more elite business people, business meetings, more education, and other experienced professionals than the average investor. The 13f filing requirement helps to narrow the gap between the average person and investors who have attended expensive, elite business schools. These pros, who already have access to lots of capital, not only had access to a costly education but also were able to build up networks to gain more information. The 13f filings help broaden this information to more than an elite few. Being able to see what percentage a pro bought a stock, in a price range, gives the average person access to information that would come up in professional conversations in elite circles that have restricted access just by virtue of who you know.

If you care about the wealth divide getting larger, please do not remove one of rules that helps to make access to information more equitable, information about what the best institutional investors in the world are doing. 

Increasing the minimum to $3.5 billion will eliminate most of the pro investors I follow, such as Guy Spier and Mohnesh Pabrai, both of whom will be excused from filing by this change.

As an individual investor, the ability to confirm some of my own research by being able to see how like-minded investors are managing their portfolio is an incredible advantage and confidence boost.  In light of the information age, the fact that we would be restricting information seems like the antithesis of what the SEC has tried to do over the course of the last 40+ years.  Transparency has always been at the forefront of what the SEC has tried to provide to investors to ensure that they were not being taken advantage of and a change in the reporting rule seems like a total about face.  Additionally, with Wall Street being massively under the microscope with the recent political turmoil, how does less transparency help to assuage the masses who feel like Wall Street is a ""Boys Club"" that is only out for themselves.

Adjusting the reporting threshold solely based on increases in market size ignores and does not account for the increasing ownership of the market by institutional investors. If one of the goals of the 13(f) disclosure program is to ""facilitate consideration of the influence and impact of institutional investment managers on the securities markets and the public policy implications of that influence."", then some compensating factor which would lower the disclosure threshold from $3.5 billion should be included."

File No. S7-08-20,Jonathan K Sheehan,none,"August 20, 2020","I disagree with the increased threshold for filing. This system was put in place to help the average investor achieve a more level playing field and benefit by seeing what the professionals are buying and selling. By raising that threshold it provides fund managers who have been purposefully keeping their funds under the threshold to avoid reporting the latitude to greatly increase their profits while still not reporting which does not seem benefit anyone other than fund mangers while hurting the average investor. Many of us rely on following these larger investors for a view of the market health and overall direction as well as identifying opportunities and re-evaluating current positions and disposition. While larger institutions make major moves within the market which create the large waves we rely on still being able to follow the smaller and nimbler investors to find our best strategies. In conclusion, I wish to say I do not see a benefit to the general public by raising the limit and believe it will hurt investors who do not want to utilize large funds to manage their investments and pay what is essentially a tax for it. For those of us who are too small to be able to enter a hedge fund, but do not wish to entrust our retirements to people who get paid whether they provide a return or not, the ability to track the moves of these smaller individual investors and funds is critical. I implore you not to make this change. Thank you."

For a retail investor we have neither the funds or influence to swing stock prices the way the hedge funds companies do.  It is useful for me to know what they are invested in so I can understand who the large influencers are on a company.  I understand that this requirement has not been adjusted since 1975 so increasing it some is reasonable.  I would like to know why this doesnt follow an increase with inflation?

It is an immense boost of confidence to a small investor to see that several professionals bought a stock that he or she is interested in. And to be able to see what percentage of the pro's portfolio went to that stock ... and at what price ... that's an incredible benefit to the smaller investors that the SEC is hoping to serve. 

Millions of small investors are becoming financially literate because of a revolution of financial information disclosure on the internet. Please do not remove the best sources of information for smaller investors about what the best institutional investors in the world are doing.

File No. S7-08-20,Jim Ryan,,"August 11, 2020","	Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will severely limit future academic research on markets, investing and securities.

	Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will reduce public companies' opportunity to know more about who their shareholders are.

	Many managers are known to talk among themselves, sharing ideas and information. They have access to company management that small investors don't. Given the SEC's emphasis on a level fair playing field, this rule change makes no sense.

	The justification for the rule change is highly questionable.

	When is less transparency and less data ever a good thing for the small investor?

	Some investors may want to avoid over-owned stocks, believing they have a high level of risk. This rule change greatly reduces individual investors ability to reduce their risk.

	In the event of a significant correction the number of reporting managers would be diminished even further.  The SP suffered a 56.4% decline during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  A similar event using the most recent quarter as an example, would have reduced the number of funds by another 31% at a time when such data is needed even more.

File No. S7-08-20,Michael  Baker,,"August 6, 2020","Hello, I am a small investor.  Congress passed the 13-f rule to better maintain a fair market for all investors.  By raising the limits on this rule from $100M to $3.5B, you are defeating the purpose of the rule, and you are giving yet another huge edge to investment managers over the small retail investors.  The costs for these money managers to file these reports are minuscule compared to the amount of money they are managing--they do not need relief--this is not a burden to them. Large money managers already have a huge advantage over small investors, and this will hurt market transparency.  This will just create more wealth inequality in our society allowing the rich to get richer.  Given this limit was instituted over 40 years ago, however, I would be in support of a more modest increase in line with the rise in inflation over this period, to $400M.  At the same time, I would suggest you reduce the window for filing these reports from 45 days to 30 days, and change the frequency to a monthly basis vs. a quarterly basis.  Given all the advances in computer technology over the last 40+ years, these money managers should be able to provide more timely reports to the public and at a much lower cost than they were 40+ years ago."

The Reporting Threshold for Institutional Investment Managers, File No: S7-08-20 proposes to remove the current transparency by raising the reporting limit from $100M to $3.5B.  As commonly known investment managers are known to talk among themselves, sharing ideas and information and have access to company management that small investors like me and many others simply can't access nor benefit.  My understanding is that the SEC supports a level playing field for all especially when you factor in the dark pool, automated trading and many other tools we as small investors just don't have.  


The $100M threshold is already a very high number in anybody's book even Warren Buffet's.  This rule change makes no sense and I urge you to drop it entirely or at least keep the $100M threshold."

File No. S7-08-20,Dennis George,,"July 27, 2020","The new rule proposes that the $100 million threshold be raised to $3.5 billion.

Buffett, Icahn and Ackman would still be required to file, as they are giants in the industry. But 90% of other institutions would not.

In the first quarter of 2020, 5,293 institutions filed 13Fs. Under the new proposal, that number would have dropped to 549.

It's not just a matter of seeing which individual star money managers bought and sold stock. Knowing if institutions are collectively buying or selling certain stocks is important information - and it's useful for companies to know who their shareholders are as well.

The strange thing is that the SEC claims it wants to increase transparency in the market, yet this rule will do exactly the opposite...

It will hide the transactions and holdings of all but the very largest institutions, keeping average investors in the dark about what the ""smart money"" is buying and selling.

Daniel Collins of WhaleWisdom says...

    Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will severely limit future academic research on markets, investing and securities.

    Raising the reporting threshold to such a high number will reduce public companies' opportunity to know more about who their shareholders are.

    Many managers are known to talk among themselves, sharing ideas and information. They have access to company management that small investors don't. Given the SEC's emphasis on a level fair playing field, this rule change makes no sense.

    The justification for the rule change is highly questionable.

    When is less transparency and less data ever a good thing for the small investor?

    Some investors may want to avoid over-owned stocks, believing they have a high level of risk. This rule change greatly reduces individual investors ability to reduce their risk.

    In the event of a significant correction the number of reporting managers would be diminished even further.  The SP suffered a 56.4% decline during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  A similar event using the most recent quarter as an example, would have reduced the number of funds by another 31% at a time when such data is needed even more.

Doing any changes to the original regulation will lead to less transparency

File No. S7-08-20,"homa karimabadi, Ph.D.",Analytics Ventures,"July 23, 2020","There is no rational basis for the proposed change. Frankly at the time when we need more transparency, this change appears to be yet another action directed by a corrupt administration that has done its best to give away everything to the super rich at the expense of everyone else. The expense of preparing the quarterly report is minimal since the reports are automated and the cost is certainly negligible compared to the money that the hedge funds rake in. So one can only wonder what the real sense of urgency is and what is the real motivation behind this change. "

File No. S7-08-20,Karel Minnaar,,"July 23, 2020",Do not approve S7-08-20. Increasing the reporting threshold will disadvantage investors and reduce transparency. The SEC should protect investors and include reporting of short positions in addition to long positions at the current threshold reporting limits.  
File No. S7-08-20,Elad Schulman,,"July 23, 2020","This is a really bad proposal, as reducing the transparency will allow hiding a lot of critical information which a lot of individuals and organizations using this information for various purposes. This goes against the freedom for information, and will hurt the ability of the SEC itself to observe key changes which can significantly impact the market.

This proposal should be dropped out entirely."
File No. S7-08-20,Steven Smith,,"July 23, 2020","For transparency, and for shareholders to be knowledgeable about their investments, it is imperative that the current thresholds remain as they are now for reporting mutual fund holdings.  I want to know if there are significant changes."
